Tweet.fm
========

Tweet.fm is a project built at Music Hackday San Francisco in 2010 and is currently running at [tweet.fm](http://tweet.fm/). The intent behind the project is to provide the missing link between Twitter and Last.fm, to allow people to share their listens and comment on their friends songs. 

It isn't really used or maintained at the moment.  Maybe someday I'll resume work on it.
